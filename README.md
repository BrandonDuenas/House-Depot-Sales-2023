### Data Preperation 

For the Data preperation and processing I completed the following:
  1. I first complied all of the data onto a new speadsheet to not modify the original spreadsheet provided by Company.
  2. Then I made all of the data unifrom by changing everything to the same: font, font size, alighnment, and borders.
  3. The raw data was then meticulously cleaned and calculated to provide the subsequent totals.
  4. Data was then transfered to Tableau Public for  data visualization and analysis.

### Exploritory Data Analysis

After meeting with the company owners we were looking to answer the following questions:
  -  What was the total for all the products sold?
  -  What was the total cost of all products?
  -  What was the total amount of warrentys sold?
  -  What was the total amount of fees paid to Square space?
  -  What was the total loss in products that arrived damaged?
  -  What was the total Profit made?
  -  what was the average amount that products spend in inventory
    
### Data Analysis

For the data analysis I used various formulas to calculate totals including:
``` Google Sheets
=SUM(cell_range)
```
``` Google Sheets
 =SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])
```
``` Google Sheets
=average(cell_range)
```
``` Google Sheets
=DATEDIF(start_date, end_date, unit)
```

### Results
  - The total amount of products sold was $263,443
  - The total cost of goods was $145,176
  - The total amount of warrentys sold was $2,930
  - The total amount of fees charged by Square space was $3,397

  - The total amount of profit was $136,547

### Recommendations

Through the analysis of House Depots sales data from 2023. Somee key areas for growth were identified includeding warrenty sales, product cost optomization, and finding an avenue to profit off damaged products recieved.

  - For warrenty sales I recommeded to: provide more warrenty knowledge, highlight peace of mind the warrenty provides, focus on the fincial protection the warrenty provides, show testimonials from customers that have purchased the warrenty, and provide deal bundles at point of purhcase.
  - For Product Cost Optimization I recommeded to analyze bids to get the best prices on productcs. They can do this by relecting on the Tableau Dashboard and analyzing past bids.
  - To Maximize on profits we came up with a couple of options to deal with damaged products including: selling products to local rage rooms, and parting out components that still work for online resale.

By following these stragies House Depot will enhance profits and buisness growth for the years to come.

### Limitations

There were some limmitations to the sales data including incomplete or missing values. Those Values were removed or highlighted to provide unskewed results.
